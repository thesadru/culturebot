# culturebot

rewrite in hikari. I love hikari.

## Structure

I hate when I can't make sense of the project structure

```
culturebot - everything that has anything to do with the actual bot
culturebot/components - actual commands
culturebot/sql - sql database managment
culturebot/sql/models - database models
culturebot/utility - various utilities that aren't specific to one command
ext - extensions to make general development easier
sever - web server for oauth and the api
```
